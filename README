A small RESTful api developed to make GET requests on a database of movies. CUrrently I have hosted an instance on Heroku.

Some functions-

1. Search a movie by its title.

Search for movie 'Star Trek' if you want a movie already present in db.

2. Return JSON objects of movies with imdb rating greater than rating input by user.

Type a number from 0 to 10.

Admins can manipulate the database.
